# SciLifeLab Data Centre Presentation Template
A latex beamer file that can be used to make presentations in a style similar to the official SciLifeLab templates.

Copy `img/`, `presentation_template.tex` and `dcpresenation.cls` to your presentation folder to use it.

`dcpresenation.cls` contains many comments and suggestions for other options; you can look there if you want to customize the settings.
